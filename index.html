I can lock in the best price for you in just **20 minutes**. Are mornings or afternoons better for a quick stop?

I wouldn't want to email you a vehicle that's sold before you even get here. I have a 15-minute slot at 4:00 PM today or 10:00 AM tomorrow. Which one works best?

I have slots available at 6 PM tonight or 10 AM tomorrow to review everything. Which works better for you to confirm the appointment?

The only way to guarantee it's here for you is to set a firm appointment. I have a 10:00 AM slot or a 3:30 PM slot. Which is safer for you?

                        **Option A (Leverage & Confidence):** I completely understand that concern. Here at the dealership, we work with over **30 different lenders**, not just the big banks, and we send them **millions of dollars of business** every year. Because of this volume, we have personal relationships and can often **call in favors** to do more for you than you could ever do on your own. The only way I can put our team to work for you is if you come in for 15 minutes. Can you be here by lunch or after work today?

                        **Option B (Focus on the Trade):** I hear you. Even if we're just working on your trade value for now, knowing that number is the first step. Can you come in so we can give you a firm, guaranteed trade value? We can talk credit later, but let's lock in your trade price today.

                        **Option A (Pre-empt Financing Fears):** Sometimes we find customers are holding back because they think they've run into a financial hurdle. As a dealership, we often have ways to help overcome those hurdles. For example:
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-3 space-y-2 pl-4">
                            <li>**First Payment:** Good news, most lenders will let us **push your first payment out 45-60 days**! That means you won't owe your current payment (we pay off that loan), and you get 1 to 2 full months before your new payment is due.</li>
                            <li>**Down Payment:** Concerned about not having the money today? We can often have you sign a **Promissory Note**, giving you **X days to gather the money** and bring it back to us. You can shop today as if you have all the down payment ready!</li>
                        </ul>
                        Knowing that, what is the next step that makes the most sense for you?
